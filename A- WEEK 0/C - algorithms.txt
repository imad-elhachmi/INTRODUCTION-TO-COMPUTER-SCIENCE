# algorithm : problem ------------------> solution -> STEP1 . STEP2 ... LAST STEP .SOLUTION
# 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 Add 2 to them -> SOLUTION 1 : 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 and SOLUTION 2 : 6 + 2 = 8
#It is best to reach a solution quickly

#Search for a person's name in a 
# book containing people's names arranged from A to Z according to a table
#      pseudocode
#Pick up phone book
#open to middle of phone book
#look at page
#    call person
#else if person is earlier in book
#    open to middle of left half of book
#    go back to line 3
#else if person is later in book
#    open to middle of right half of book
#    go back to line 3
#else 
#    Quit
